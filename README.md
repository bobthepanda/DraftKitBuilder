# DraftKitBuilder

CSE 219 Project: Built a Fantasy Baseball Draft Manager that could be easily modified for other fantasy sports.

A JavaFX application that loads the elements of a JSon file and translates it into a roster of athletes and their statistics. It also keeps track of any user-created fantasy teams, and players can be added or removed using the application.
